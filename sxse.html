        <h1 class="sxse-main-title">SXSE Wrapped Internship</h1>
        <div class="sxse-intro">
          <p>This internship from my school allowed us students to intern at "spotify" to develop skills that would assist me in my future career goals. We were assigned with producing a "spotify wrapped" sort of page about our imaginative person's experience at the South By South East event in Richmond, VA. Each group member had to work on different team each week/sprint. </p>

            <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
            <p>This week, I was on the Marketing team and made a tiktok video to promote SXSE event in RVA. This video was meant to promote the event by showcasing types of programs the event will have. Through this project, I learned how marketing works and the importance of marketing. I didn't expect marketing to have a big value but I found out it does.</p>

            <h2>Sprint 2</h2>
            <p>I was put on the development team this week. I was tasked with making changes to the already established website. I added functionality to the website and added additional features like making the website move left and right depending on where you click and moving when you press left and right keys.</p>

          <h2>Sprint 3</h2>
          <p class="w-75">I was on the data team for this sprint. I was assigned to research and bring forth data and make a data visualization of that to put on our wrapped screen. This data visualization was asked to be linked to our persona, Mike. During this week, I learned new tools to help me make the  visualization that I think will help me in the future.</p>
